 	    <p>This is your time for a divine word from the God who created the universe. Your hope doesn't come from the external things of life nor does it come from a person.  God is willing to show you who He truly is. Will you allow Him to be first in your life?  If you have been searching for your purpose - search no more - Christ Jesus is the way, truth and life no man is going to come before God but through Him.

Give Him Praise! There is nothing too hard for Him, for He is the great I am!  Make sure you enjoy your morning, afternoon, evening and night. Remember to bless His Holy name. I do not say the above-mentioned words lightly, for we are all faced with different situations in our lives. The antidote is to put Christ Jesus first.<br>Find comfort in this! You may be suppressed with various unfortunate circumstances (self-inflicted or the curveballs of life). Rest with certainty, the Holy Word of God moves mountains. We are blessed by His grace, mercy, compassionate, forgiveness, tender mercies, goodness, kindness, righteousness and His great love. Now, put a praise on your lips. Make a joyful sound unto the Lord!<br>Prayer<br>Father God thank you for this day. It is a special day in which I knew right from the initial start your power and presence were incorporated. God thank you for the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit! As you have given this day Ancient of Days, I will give myself freely to you. Selah!</h5>
